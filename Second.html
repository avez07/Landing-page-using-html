   <h1>Some Importance About Football</h1>
    <p class="information"><b>Football</b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, <u>kicking a ball to score a goal.</u>
         Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where 
         the word is used.<b><u> Sports commonly called football</u></b> include association football (known as soccer in
          North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football)
          ; Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various
           forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as <b>football codes.</b></p>

           <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in 
            many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to 
            the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The
             expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread
              to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th
               century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, <br>for example,
                deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain 
                their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of
                 many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various
                  kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</p>
